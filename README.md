# Nyx String Utilities

Nyx String Utilities offers a wide range of string processing and manipulation functions to handle a wide variety of text wrangling tasks. The library is the backbone of the [Nyx Programming Language's](https://github.com/NyxLang/nyx) String type, but it is also perfectly suitable for use in other projects.

We spend nearly as much time on the documentation as on the code to make sure you don't have any trouble finding and using what you need. We also support use in both browser and Node.js environments, and you can either `require` the library or `import` it as an ECMAScript module.
